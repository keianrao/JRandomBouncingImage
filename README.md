A simulator/clone of a screensaver in <abbr title="Common Desktop Environment">CDE</abbr>, called 'Random bouncing image'. It's a bit of a misnomer since nothing is bouncing, and there's not much randomisation..

This program does try to go fullscreen and will quit when the mouse is moved, but I'm not sure if it can actually be set as a screensaver.

Recording of JRandomBouncingImage:
![A collection of X Window System logos in various colours are placed randomly around the screen, against a black background. Periodically their locations and colours are changed.](RecordingThis.gif)

Recording of original 'Random bouncing image' screensaver:
![There's slightly less logos and their edges are pixel-sharp rather than anti-aliased, but otherwise the behaviour is similar.](RecordingOriginal.gif)
